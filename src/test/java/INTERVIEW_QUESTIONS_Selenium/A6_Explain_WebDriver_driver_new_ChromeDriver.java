Breakdown of the Code

1.WebDriver Interface:
--WebDriver is an interface provided by the Selenium framework. 
It defines a set of methods (such as get(), findElement(), click() etc.) that all browser drivers (specifically ChromeDriver, FirefoxDriver, etc.) must implement.
This allows Selenium to provide a unified programming interface for developers to interact with various browsers.

2.driver:
 --By declaring the driver variable as a WebDriver, you can easily switch to another browserâ€™s driver later on without changing much of your code.


3.ChromeDriver Class:
ChromeDriver is a class that implements the WebDriver interface specifically for the Google Chrome browser.
When you create an instance of ChromeDriver, it internally sets up the Chrome browser for automation, launching an instance of Chrome that can be controlled via Selenium commands.
Creating an Instance:

WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

This line does several things:
It invokes the constructor of the ChromeDriver class.
The ChromeDriver constructor typically performs the following actions:
It initializes the ChromeDriver executable, which must be specified by setting the system property webdriver.chrome.driver.
It opens a new Chrome browser window (or tab) and starts a communication session with the browser through the WebDriver protocol.
The instance is assigned to the variable driver, which can be used to access the methods of the WebDriver interface.


What Happens Under the Hood
WebDriver Protocol:
Selenium communicates with the Chrome browser using the WebDriver protocol (which is a JSON Wire Protocol in older versions). 
When you call new ChromeDriver(), it establishes a connection with the browser,
 allowing you to send commands and receive responses.
Summary of Understanding Constructors in Java and ChromeDriver Constructor







Understanding Constructors in Java:
===============================================

Definition: A constructor is a special method in Java called when an object is instantiated from a class. 
Its primary role is to initialize the newly created object and perform necessary startup tasks.

Key Characteristics:
1.Same Name as the Class: The constructor shares the same name as the class.
2.No Return Type: Constructors do not have a return type, not even void.
3.Invoked Automatically: When using the new keyword to create an object, the constructor is invoked automatically.

The ChromeDriver Constructor:
-------------------------------------
1.Initialization: Calling new ChromeDriver() invokes the constructor to initialize critical components for controlling the Chrome browser.

2.Default Constructor: Typically, the ChromeDriver class has a default constructor that performs tasks such as:
A.Loading the WebDriver Executable: 
 -Automatically loads the necessary ChromeDriver executable specified via System.setProperty('webdriver.chrome.driver', 'path/to/chromedriver');.
B.Starting a New Browser Session: 
- Establishes a connection to the ChromeDriver server and opens a new browser window or tab.
C.Configuring Capabilities: 
--Sets default capabilities for the browser session (e.g., window size, headless mode).
D.Establishing a Communication Channel: 
--Sets up the communication between WebDriver and the Chrome browser using the WebDriver protocol.

	 * DETAILED Understanding Constructors in Java
	 * ----------------------------------------
A constructor in Java is a special method that is called when an object is instantiated from a class. 
It initializes the newly created object and can set properties or 
perform any startup tasks required to prepare the object for use. 

Constructors have the following characteristics:
------------------------------------------------------
1.Same Name as the Class: The constructor has the same name as the class.
2.No Return Type: Constructors do not have a return type, not even void.
3.Invoked Automatically: When you use the new keyword to create an object, the constructor is invoked automatically.

The ChromeDriver Constructor
In the context of the ChromeDriver class:

Initialization:

When new ChromeDriver() is called, the constructor of the ChromeDriver class initializes a number of critical components necessary for controlling the Chrome browser.

Default Constructor:
-------------------------
The ChromeDriver class typically has a default constructor that does not take any parameters.
 When invoked, it may perform the following tasks:
1.Load the WebDriver Executable: 
    It automatically loads the necessary ChromeDriver executable,
    which you must specify beforehand using System.setProperty('webdriver.chrome.driver', 'path/to/chromedriver');
 . Internally, the constructor may check if the path to the executable is valid.
 
2.Start a New Browser Session: The constructor establishes a connection to the ChromeDriver server (which is essentially a standalone server that drives the browser) and opens a new browser window or tab.
3.Configure Capabilities: It configures any default capabilities for the Chrome browser session. This includes settings like window size, headless mode, etc.
4.Establish a Communication Channel: It sets up the communication channel between the WebDriver and the Chrome browser using the WebDriver protocol, allowing for command and control interaction.
What Happens Internally
When the ChromeDriver constructor is invoked:

Creating a New Instance:
---------------------------
An object of ChromeDriver is created in memory, and its reference is assigned to the driver variable.

Loading Dependencies:
---------------------------
The constructor might load specific configurations, dependencies, or libraries needed for browser automation, ensuring the necessary settings are correctly applied.
Opening Chrome Browser:
A new instance of the Chrome browser is launched. 

This task can involve:
Starting the Chrome browser executable.
Launching a new user session for the browser.
Configuring any predefined preferences, such as incognito mode, disabling extensions, etc.
Error Handling:

If there are issues loading the driver or starting the browser (like a version mismatch), the constructor may throw exceptions (e.g., SessionNotCreatedException), which you need to handle properly in your code.
