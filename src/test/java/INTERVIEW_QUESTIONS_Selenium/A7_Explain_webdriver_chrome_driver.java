	 * 
	 * The "webdriver.chrome.driver" property is a fundamental configuration element in Selenium WebDriver
	 *  that allows users to automate and control the Google Chrome browser. 
	 *  
	 * This property tells Selenium where to find the ChromeDriver executable, 
	 * which is necessary for establishing a connection between the Selenium script and the Chrome browser for automation tasks. 
	 * 
	 * Below, we will explore its purpose, usage, and relevant aspects in detail.

Purpose of webdriver.chrome.driver
=========================================
Executable Path Identification:

The primary purpose of the webdriver.chrome.driver property is to point to the location of the ChromeDriver executable file on your system. Without specifying this property, Selenium will not be able to locate the driver required to control the Chrome browser.
Enabling Chrome Automation:

By setting this property correctly, you allow your Selenium scripts to launch, control, and automate tasks within the Chrome browser. This includes navigation, interaction with web elements, and handling various browser sessions.


Setting the Property
To set the webdriver.chrome.driver property in your Java code, 
you need to use the System.setProperty method before creating an instance of the ChromeDriver. 

Here's how you can do this:

System.setProperty('webdriver.chrome.driver', 'path/to/chromedriver');

Key: 'webdriver.chrome.driver' - This is the identifier that Selenium uses to recognize which WebDriver it needs to interact with.
Value: 'path/to/chromedriver' - This should be replaced with the absolute path to the ChromeDriver executable file on your machine, such as /usr/local/bin/chromedriver on macOS/Linux or C:\path\to\chromedriver.exe on Windows.
